NAME
       regcomp, regexec, regerror, regfree - regular-expression library

SYNOPSIS
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <regex.h>

       int regcomp(regex_t *preg, const char *pattern, int cflags);

       int regexec(const regex_t *preg,   const char *string,   size_t nmatch,
                 regmatch_t pmatch[], int eflags);

       size_t regerror(int errcode,     const regex_t *preg,     char *errbuf,
                 size_t errbuf_size);

       void regfree(regex_t *preg);

DESCRIPTION
       These  routines  implement  POSIX 1003.2 regular expressions (``RE''s);
       see regex(7).  Regcomp compiles an RE  written  as  a  string  into  an
       internal  form, regexec matches that internal form against a string and
       reports results, regerror  transforms  error  codes  from  either  into
       human-readable  messages,  and  regfree frees any dynamically-allocated
       storage used by the internal form of an RE.

       The header <regex.h> declares two structure  types,  regex_t  and  reg-
       match_t,  the  former  for  compiled  internal forms and the latter for
       match reporting.  It also declares the four functions, a type regoff_t,
       and a number of constants with names starting with ``REG_''.

       Regcomp  compiles  the  regular  expression  contained  in  the pattern
       string, subject to the flags in cflags, and places the results  in  the
       regex_t structure pointed to by preg.  Cflags is the bitwise OR of zero
       or more of the following flags:

       REG_EXTENDED  Compile modern (``extended'') REs, rather than the  obso-
                     lete (``basic'') REs that are the default.

       REG_BASIC     This  is  a  synonym  for 0, provided as a counterpart to
                     REG_EXTENDED to improve readability.  This is  an  exten-
                     sion,  compatible with but not specified by POSIX 1003.2,
                     and should be used with caution in software  intended  to
                     be portable to other systems.

       REG_NOSPEC    Compile with recognition of all special characters turned
                     off.  All characters are thus considered ordinary, so the
                     ``RE''  is  a literal string.  This is an extension, com-
                     patible with but  not  specified  by  POSIX  1003.2,  and
                     should  be  used  with caution in software intended to be
                     portable to other systems.  REG_EXTENDED  and  REG_NOSPEC
                     may not be used in the same call to regcomp.

       REG_ICASE     Compile  for  matching that ignores upper/lower case dis-
                     tinctions.  See regex(7).

       REG_NOSUB     Compile for matching that need  only  report  success  or
                     failure, not what was matched.

       REG_NEWLINE   Compile for newline-sensitive matching.  By default, new-
                     line is a completely ordinary character with  no  special
                     meaning  in  either REs or strings.  With this flag, `[^'
                     bracket expressions and `.' never match  newline,  a  `^'
                     anchor  matches  the null string after any newline in the
                     string in addition to its normal function,  and  the  `$'
                     anchor  matches the null string before any newline in the
                     string in addition to its normal function.

       REG_PEND      The regular expression ends, not at the  first  NUL,  but
                     just  before the character pointed to by the re_endp mem-
                     ber of the structure pointed to  by  preg.   The  re_endp
                     member is of type const char *.  This flag permits inclu-
                     sion of NULs in the  RE;  they  are  considered  ordinary
                     characters.   This  is  an extension, compatible with but
                     not specified by POSIX 1003.2, and should  be  used  with
                     caution in software intended to be portable to other sys-
                     tems.

       When successful, regcomp returns 0 and fills in the  structure  pointed
       to  by preg.  One member of that structure (other than re_endp) is pub-
       licized: re_nsub, of type size_t, contains the number of  parenthesized
       subexpressions  within  the RE (except that the value of this member is
       undefined if the REG_NOSUB  flag  was  used).   If  regcomp  fails,  it
       returns a non-zero error code; see DIAGNOSTICS.

       Regexec  matches the compiled RE pointed to by preg against the string,
       subject to the flags in  eflags,  and  reports  results  using  nmatch,
       pmatch,  and  the  returned value.  The RE must have been compiled by a
       previous invocation of regcomp.  The compiled form is not altered  dur-
       ing  execution of regexec, so a single compiled RE can be used simulta-
       neously by multiple threads.

       By default, the NUL-terminated string pointed to by string  is  consid-
       ered  to be the text of an entire line, with the NUL indicating the end
       of the line.  (That is, any other end-of-line marker is  considered  to
       have been removed and replaced by the NUL.)  The eflags argument is the
       bitwise OR of zero or more of the following flags:

       REG_NOTBOL    The first character of the string is not the beginning of
                     a  line,  so  the  `^' anchor should not match before it.
                     This does not  affect  the  behavior  of  newlines  under
                     REG_NEWLINE.

       REG_NOTEOL    The  NUL  terminating  the string does not end a line, so
                     the `$' anchor should not match before it.  This does not
                     affect the behavior of newlines under REG_NEWLINE.

       REG_STARTEND  The   string   is   considered   to   start  at  string +
                     pmatch[0].rm_so and to have a terminating NUL located  at
                     string +  pmatch[0].rm_eo  (there  need not actually be a
                     NUL at that location), regardless of the value of nmatch.
                     See  below for the definition of pmatch and nmatch.  This
                     is an extension, compatible with  but  not  specified  by
                     POSIX 1003.2, and should be used with caution in software
                     intended to be portable to other systems.   Note  that  a
                     non-zero  rm_so  does  not imply REG_NOTBOL; REG_STARTEND
                     affects only the location of the string, not  how  it  is
                     matched.

       See regex(7) for a discussion of what is matched in situations where an
       RE or a portion thereof  could  match  any  of  several  substrings  of
       string.

       Normally,   regexec  returns  0  for  success  and  the  non-zero  code
       REG_NOMATCH for failure.  Other non-zero error codes may be returned in
       exceptional situations; see DIAGNOSTICS.

       If  REG_NOSUB  was specified in the compilation of the RE, or if nmatch
       is 0, regexec ignores the pmatch argument (but see below for  the  case
       where REG_STARTEND is specified).  Otherwise, pmatch points to an array
       of nmatch structures of type regmatch_t.  Such a structure has at least
       the members rm_so and rm_eo, both of type regoff_t (a signed arithmetic
       type at least as large as an off_t and a ssize_t),  containing  respec-
       tively  the offset of the first character of a substring and the offset
       of the first character after the end of  the  substring.   Offsets  are
       measured  from  the  beginning of the string argument given to regexec.
       An empty substring is denoted by equal  offsets,  both  indicating  the
       character following the empty substring.

       The  0th  member of the pmatch array is filled in to indicate what sub-
       string of string was matched  by  the  entire  RE.   Remaining  members
       report  what  substring  was  matched  by  parenthesized subexpressions
       within the RE; member i reports subexpression  i,  with  subexpressions
       counted  (starting  at  1) by the order of their opening parentheses in
       the RE, left to right.   Unused  entries  in  the  array--corresponding
       either  to subexpressions that did not participate in the match at all,
       or to subexpressions that  do  not  exist  in  the  RE  (that  is,  i >
       preg->re_nsub)--have  both  rm_so and rm_eo set to -1.  If a subexpres-
       sion participated in the match several times, the reported substring is
       the last one it matched.  (Note, as an example in particular, that when
       the RE `(b*)+' matches `bbb', the parenthesized  subexpression  matches
       the  three  `b's and then an infinite number of empty strings following
       the last `b', so the reported substring is one of the empties.)

       If REG_STARTEND is specified, pmatch must point to at  least  one  reg-
       match_t  (even  if nmatch is 0 or REG_NOSUB was specified), to hold the
       input offsets for REG_STARTEND.  Use for output is still entirely  con-
       trolled by nmatch; if nmatch is 0 or REG_NOSUB was specified, the value
       of pmatch[0] will not be changed by a successful regexec.

       Regerror maps a non-zero errcode from either regcomp or  regexec  to  a
       human-readable, printable message.  If preg is non-NULL, the error code
       should have arisen from use of the regex_t pointed to by preg,  and  if
       the  error  code came from regcomp, it should have been the result from
       the most recent regcomp using that regex_t.  (Regerror may be  able  to
       supply  a  more  detailed  message using information from the regex_t.)
       Regerror places the NUL-terminated message into the buffer  pointed  to
       by  errbuf,  limiting  the  length  (including  the  NUL)  to  at  most
       errbuf_size bytes.  If the whole message won't fit, as much  of  it  as
       will  fit  before  the  terminating  NUL is supplied.  In any case, the
       returned value is the size of buffer needed to hold the  whole  message
       (including  terminating  NUL).   If errbuf_size is 0, errbuf is ignored
       but the return value is still correct.

       If the errcode given to regerror  is  first  ORed  with  REG_ITOA,  the
       ``message''  that results is the printable name of the error code, e.g.
       ``REG_NOMATCH'', rather than an explanation  thereof.   If  errcode  is
       REG_ATOI,  then  preg  shall  be non-NULL and the re_endp member of the
       structure it points to must point to the printable  name  of  an  error
       code;  in  this case, the result in errbuf is the decimal digits of the
       numeric value of the error code (0 if  the  name  is  not  recognized).
       REG_ITOA  and  REG_ATOI are intended primarily as debugging facilities;
       they are extensions, compatible with but not specified by POSIX 1003.2,
       and  should be used with caution in software intended to be portable to
       other systems.  Be warned also that they  are  considered  experimental
       and changes are possible.

       Regfree  frees  any  dynamically-allocated  storage associated with the
       compiled RE pointed to by preg.  The remaining regex_t is no  longer  a
       valid compiled RE and the effect of supplying it to regexec or regerror
       is undefined.

       None of these functions references global variables except  for  tables
       of  constants;  all are safe for use from multiple threads if the argu-
       ments are safe.

IMPLEMENTATION CHOICES
       There are a number of decisions that 1003.2 leaves up to the  implemen-
       tor,  either  by  explicitly  saying ``undefined'' or by virtue of them
       being forbidden by the RE grammar.  This implementation treats them  as
       follows.

       See  regex(7)  for  a  discussion of the definition of case-independent
       matching.

       There is no particular limit on the length of REs,  except  insofar  as
       memory  is  limited.   Memory usage is approximately linear in RE size,
       and largely insensitive to RE complexity, except  for  bounded  repeti-
       tions.   See  BUGS for one short RE using them that will run almost any
       system out of memory.

       A backslashed character other than one specifically given a magic mean-
       ing  by  1003.2 (such magic meanings occur only in obsolete [``basic'']
       REs) is taken as an ordinary character.

       Any unmatched [ is a REG_EBRACK error.

       Equivalence classes cannot begin or end bracket-expression ranges.  The
       endpoint of one range cannot begin another.

       RE_DUP_MAX,  the  limit on repetition counts in bounded repetitions, is
       255.

       A repetition operator (?, *, +, or bounds) cannot follow another  repe-
       tition  operator.   A repetition operator cannot begin an expression or
       subexpression or follow `^' or `|'.

       `|' cannot appear first or last in a (sub)expression or  after  another
       `|', i.e. an operand of `|' cannot be an empty subexpression.  An empty
       parenthesized subexpression,  `()',  is  legal  and  matches  an  empty
       (sub)string.  An empty string is not a legal RE.

       A  `{'  followed by a digit is considered the beginning of bounds for a
       bounded repetition, which must then follow the syntax  for  bounds.   A
       `{' not followed by a digit is considered an ordinary character.

       `^' and `$' beginning and ending subexpressions in obsolete (``basic'')
       REs are anchors, not ordinary characters.

HISTORY
       Written by Henry Spencer, henry@zoo.toronto.edu.

BUGS
       This is an alpha release with known defects.  Please report problems.

       There  is  one known functionality bug.  The implementation of interna-
       tionalization is incomplete: the locale is always  assumed  to  be  the
       default  one  of  1003.2,  and only the collating elements etc. of that
       locale are available.

       The back-reference code is subtle and doubts linger about its  correct-
       ness in complex cases.

       Regexec  performance  is  poor.  This will improve with later releases.
       Nmatch exceeding 0 is expensive; nmatch exceeding 1 is worse.   Regexec
       is largely insensitive to RE complexity except that back references are
       massively expensive.  RE length does matter; in particular, there is  a
       strong  speed  bonus  for  keeping RE length under about 30 characters,
       with most special characters counting roughly double.

       Regcomp implements bounded repetitions by  macro  expansion,  which  is
       costly in time and space if counts are large or bounded repetitions are
       nested.             An            RE             like,             say,
       `((((a{1,100}){1,100}){1,100}){1,100}){1,100}'  will  (eventually)  run
       almost any existing machine out of swap space.

       There are suspected problems with response to obscure error conditions.
       Notably,  certain  kinds  of  internal overflow, produced only by truly
       enormous REs or by multiply nested bounded  repetitions,  are  probably
       not handled well.

       Due to a mistake in 1003.2, things like `a)b' are legal REs because `)'
       is a special character only in the presence  of  a  previous  unmatched
       `('.  This can't be fixed until the spec is fixed.

       The  standard's  definition  of back references is vague.  For example,
       does `a\(\(b\)*\2\)*d' match `abbbd'?  Until the standard is clarified,
       behavior in such cases should not be relied on.

       The  implementation of word-boundary matching is a bit of a kludge, and
       bugs may lurk in combinations of word-boundary matching and anchoring.
