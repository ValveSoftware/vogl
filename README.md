vogl
=============

#### NOTE ####

April 16, 2014: Vogl history has been completely and utterly trounced. The original repository had an entire chroot build system that most folks weren't interested in. A few contributors (thanks Carl & Sir Anthony) took the time to build a much smaller source only vogl repository which we've replaced the original one with.

A separate chroot repository (which will build this source repository) is now here:

https://bitbucket.org/raddebugger/vogl_chroot

## Warning ##

This project is alpha^2. If you are up for suffering through a bit of pain with early releases, please jump in - we'd love to have your help...

## Dependencies ##

The chroot configuration script should be a good reference for vogl dependencies. It is located here:

https://bitbucket.org/raddebugger/vogl_chroot/src/master/bin/chroot_configure.sh?at=master

## Get Source and Build ##

#### Linux ####

```
git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/vogl.git  
mkdir -p vogl/vogl_build/release64 && cd $_  
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_X64=On ../..
make -j 10
```

The binaries are placed in the vogl/vogl_build directory.

For debug builds, use "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug"  
For 32-bit builds, use "-DBUILD_X64=Off"  

#### Windows ####

```
git clone https://github.com/ValveSoftware/vogl.git
mkdir -p vogl\vogl_build\x64
cd vogl\vogl_build\x64
cmake -DQt5_DIR="C:\Qt\5.3\msvc2013_64_opengl\lib\cmake\Qt5" -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..\..
cd ..\..\..\
mkdir -p vogl\vogl_build\win32
cd vogl\vogl_build\win32
cmake -DQt5_DIR="C:\Qt\5.3\msvc2013_opengl\lib\cmake\Qt5" -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" ..\..
```

Note: The path to Qt5 might need to be adjusted depending on your install location.
After compiling with Visual Studio, the binaries are placed in the vogl\vogl_build\Release (or Debug) directory.

## Capturing ##

```
cd vogl_build
VOGL_CMD_LINE="--vogl_tracefile vogltrace.glxspheres64.bin" LD_PRELOAD=$(readlink -f libvogltrace64.so) ./glxspheres64  
```

For capturing Steam games, please see the vogl_trace.sh script in the chroot repository:

https://bitbucket.org/raddebugger/vogl_chroot/src/master/bin/src/sl.cpp?at=master

We are currently working on making it much easier to launch and profile Steam apps.

## Replay ##

```
./voglreplay64 play vogltrace.glxspheres64.bin
```

or launch `vogleditor64` and open trace file.
